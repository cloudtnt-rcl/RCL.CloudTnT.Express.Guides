# Trusted Issuers
**V1.0**

A hoster of a wallet application will maintain a curated list of Trusted Issuers. Holders will be able to store credentials in the wallet issued by one of these Trusted Issuers.

The hoster may choose an Issuer based on any of the following :

- The Issuer is recognized as credible by the hoster
- The Issuer has obtain approvals, accreditation or licenses 
- The Issuer is endorsed by companies in a occupational sector

In this way, the hoster will maintain the quality of their hosted wallet application by only allowing credentials from Trusted Issuers.

A hoster can configure the wallet application to include an online form, eg. Google Forms or Microsoft Forms for issuers to apply to be added to the Trusted Issuers list in the wallet application.
