# Sharing Digital Credentials
**V1.0**

Holders can share credentials with verifiers who will make a determination about their achievements, for instance, for hiring or promotion purses. Verifiers may include employers.

# Groups

In the wallet application, holders can organize their credentials within groups. Groups will contain credentials related to a common work area. For instance,  groups for a software developer may include databases, front end development, back end development, etc.

When credentials are organized withing groups, it makes the sharing experience better for the verifier.

# Verifiers

A holder can share their credentials with one or more verifiers. Verifiers may include employers, peers, trainers, etc. The verifier must login to the wallet application to view a learner's credentials.

A holder can select which verifier should see their personal information, in addition, the holder can remove verifier sharing at any time.
